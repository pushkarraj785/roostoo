Here’s a clear explanation of your project’s architecture and code:

## 1. Project Overview

You have built a reinforcement learning (RL) trading system for Bitcoin (BTC) using real 1-hour historical data, technical indicators, and the PPO algorithm from stable-baselines3. The system is modular and consists of:

- A custom Gymnasium-compatible trading environment (gym_env.py)
- A training script (train_ppo_btc.py)
- Data files (btc_usdt_1h_binance.csv)
- A trained model (ppo_btc_moderate_trader.zip)

---

## 2. Data

- **btc_usdt_1h_binance.csv**: Contains 1 year of hourly BTC/USDT OHLCV data (timestamp, open, high, low, close, volume).
- Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, EMA) are calculated on the close price using pandas_ta and added as columns.

---

## 3. Custom Environment (gym_env.py)

### a. LookBack Class

- Manages a rolling buffer of historical data (prices, indicators, etc.) using a deque.
- Can be extended to save/load data from CSV/Parquet.

### b. RoostooTradingEnv Class

- Inherits from `gymnasium.Env` (formerly `gym.Env`).
- Simulates a trading environment with:
  - **State**: balance, asset holdings, prices, indicators.
  - **Action**: continuous vector per asset (buy/sell/hold).
  - **Reward**: change in portfolio value after each step.
  - **Step logic**: executes trades, updates balance/holdings, simulates price/indicator changes (in the base class).
- Designed to be extended for real data and custom indicators.

---

## 4. Training Script (train_ppo_btc.py)

### a. Data Preparation

- Loads the CSV into a pandas DataFrame.
- Calculates RSI, MACD, and EMA using pandas_ta.
- Drops rows with NaN values (due to indicator lookback).

### b. Custom Environment for Real Data

- **BTCTradingEnv**: Inherits from `RoostooTradingEnv`.
  - Uses real price and indicator data from the DataFrame.
  - At each step, sets the current price and indicators from the DataFrame row.
  - Handles trading logic and reward calculation as before.
  - Follows the Gymnasium API: `reset()` returns `(obs, info)`, `step()` returns `(obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info)`.

### c. Training

- Instantiates the environment with the prepared DataFrame.
- Checks environment compliance with `check_env`.
- Trains a PPO agent (`stable-baselines3`) for 10,000 timesteps.
- Saves the trained model as ppo_btc_moderate_trader.zip.

---

## 5. RL Loop

- At each step, the agent receives an observation (balance, holdings, price, indicators).
- The agent outputs an action (how much to buy/sell).
- The environment executes the trade, updates the state, and returns the new observation and reward.
- The PPO agent learns to maximize the portfolio value over time.

---

## 6. Key Technologies

- **pandas**: Data manipulation.
- **pandas_ta**: Technical indicator calculation.
- **gymnasium**: RL environment interface.
- **stable-baselines3**: RL algorithms (PPO).
- **numpy**: Numerical operations.

---

## 7. Output

- The trained PPO model is saved and can be used for evaluation, backtesting, or live trading simulation.

---

**Summary:**  
You have a modular RL trading system using real BTC data, technical indicators, a custom Gymnasium environment, and PPO. The architecture is clean and extensible for further research or production use.
